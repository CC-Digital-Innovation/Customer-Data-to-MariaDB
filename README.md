# Customer Data to MariaDB

## Summary
Gathers all ServiceNow tickets and Opsgenie alerts from configured instances
and pushes the data to a configured MariaDB database. It will seed empty
tables of the data, updates non-closed tickets / alerts, and pushes any new
data that is missing from the database every time the script is run.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Keeping a historical record of tickets and alerts for customers allows us to
make powerful dashboards and interpret the data not only for our customers, but
also for ourselves. We can get much more detailed metrics on our business and
our customer's businesses.
